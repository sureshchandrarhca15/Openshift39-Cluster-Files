Lab: Blue-Green Deployment 
##########################

Create a new project:

[root@master ~]# oc new-project bluegreen --description="Blue Green Deployment" --display-name="bluegreen"

Go to Openshift Dashboard and Select bluegreen Project 

Click on "Browse Catalog" Select "PHP" Builder Image -> Next 

Version					:	7.1 - latest 

Application Name		:	blueapp

Git Repository			:	https://github.com/sureshchandrarhca15/openshift-bluegreen.git

Expend "Advanced Options" and uncheck the box of "Create a route to the application" in Routing Section. We will create the route later. 

Click on Create. 

Now go to Overview to see the status. You can also use the CLI to see the status. 

[root@master ~]# oc project bluegreen

[root@master ~]# oc get bc
NAME      TYPE      FROM         LATEST
blueapp   Source    Git@master   1

[root@master ~]# oc logs -f bc/blueapp

[root@master ~]# oc get dc
NAME      REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
blueapp   1          1         1         config,image(blueapp:latest)


[root@master ~]# oc get rc
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
blueapp-1   1         1         1         42s


[root@master ~]# oc get svc
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
blueapp   ClusterIP   172.30.112.74   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   7m


Let's create a route for this application: 

[root@master ~]# oc expose service blueapp --name=bluegreen --hostname=bluegreen.apps.openshift.example.com

[root@master ~]# oc get route
NAME        HOST/PORT                    PATH  			    SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen.apps.openshift.example.com             blueapp    8080-tcp                 None


Now Open Web Browser and Point to the below URL to access the Application: 


http://bluegreen.apps.example.com



Now let's Deploy the Green Application 

First we need to change in Git Repository Code to make the green colour box. You need to modify "image.php" 


Go to Openshift Dashboard and Select bluegreen Project 

Click on "Add to Project" Dropdown Menu -> "Browse Catalog" Select "PHP" Builder Image -> Next 

Version					:	7.1 - latest 

Application Name		:	greenapp

Git Repository			:	https://github.com/sureshchandrarhca15/openshift-bluegreen.git

Expend "Advanced Options" and uncheck the box of "Create a route to the application" in Routing Section. We will use the same route  which we have created previously for blueapp. 

Click on Create. 

Now go to Overview to see the status. You can also use the CLI to see the status. 

[root@master ~]# oc get bc
NAME       TYPE      FROM         LATEST
blueapp    Source    Git@master   1
greenapp   Source    Git@master   1

[root@master ~]# oc logs -f bc/greenapp


[root@master ~]# oc get dc
NAME       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
blueapp    1          1         1         config,image(blueapp:latest)
greenapp   1          1         1         config,image(greenapp:latest)


[root@master ~]# oc get rc
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
blueapp-1    1         1         1         14m
greenapp-1   1         1         1         1m

[root@master ~]# oc get svc
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
blueapp    ClusterIP   172.30.112.74   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   21m
greenapp   ClusterIP   172.30.74.6     <none>        8080/TCP            4m


[root@master ~]# oc get route
NAME        HOST/PORT                		    PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen.apps.openshift.example.com             blueapp    8080-tcp                 None



Now lets change the route from blueapp to greenapp Service 

[root@master ~]# oc edit route bluegreen

spec:
  host: bluegreen.apps.example.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: greenapp				# Change blueapp to greenapp Service 
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None

:wq (save and exit) 


[root@master ~]# oc get route
NAME        HOST/PORT                    PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen.apps.example.com             greenapp   8080-tcp                 None



Now Refresh the Below URL: 

http://bluegreen.apps.openshift.example.com/

You shoud see green box. If there is some issue in Greenapp Deployment, You can rollback to Blueapp Deployment By using the same way. 


Congratulations, you have successfully done Bluegreen Deployment in Openshift Cluster.
